The position, based within the Program in Artificial Intelligence at 12R, entails working closely with a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with training from leading universities like MITI Stanford and CMU.</p><p>Listed below are problems of interest for this engineering position in the Deep Learning 2.0 project:</p><p><strong>Multimodal Deep Learning: Towards effective learning from heterogeneous data sources</strong></p><p>Currently, deep learning is applied in various areas such as visual computing, speech recognition, text mining, etc. in each area, the learning model is trained with large amounts of data in isolation. A multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources, including video, speech, text, etc. is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Unsupervised Deep Learning: Towards 10X fewer labeled samples</strong></p><p>Labeling large amounts of training data is one of the most time-consuming steps in the deep learning pipeline, and is often not feasible. The aim is to achieve the same performance with 1.0x fewer labeled training samples. This is a strong step in the direction of unsupervised deep learning, where representations are learnt with large amounts of unlabeled unstructured data,</p><p> </p><p><strong>Deep Learning on Embedded Devices: Towards 1.00X smaller models</strong></p><p>Current deep learning models have 10s of millions of neurons, making it infeasible for deployment on mobile and embedded hardware. The aim is to achieve models that are 100x smaller, with little loss in performance. This capability will also be critical for emerging neuromorphic platforms, where the number of spiking neurons is orders of magnitude smaller than in current state-of-the-art deep learning models.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Online Deep Learning: Towards Near RealTime (NRT) model updates</strong></p><p>State-of-the-art deep learning models still take several days to train on expensive GPU infrastructure. A common problem is when new data (including new classes) are constantly added to an evolving, always-learning system. Algorithms to move towards real-time updates will be essential.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Extreme Deep Learning: Training IB neural networks efficiently</strong></p><p>The high model capacity of deep networks is why increasing amounts of data and model size improves performance. However, there are substantial challenges in hardware and algorithms challenges in training very large models efficiently. The aim is to address these challenges to achieve more efficient training</p><p> </p><p><strong>Deep Learning for Spoken Language Processing and Understanding: Towards better modeling of human communication</strong></p><p>Language technology has made great advances through deep learning in the past five years, penetrating fields such as speech recognition and machine translation. However, there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed, ranging from the requirement of specialized linguistic resources to large amounts of annotated data, and to insufficient theoretical grounding in deep learning. This aim attempts to address challenges that are often overlooked by major commercial AI players.</p><p> </p><p><strong>White-Box Deep Learning: Towards interpretable and contextually informed models</strong></p><p>Current deep learning models are largely black-boxes that are not informed by contextual relations and provide little intuition. Improved abilities to regulate the learning process, and interpret the resulting predictions will be essential for the next wave of AI applications - especially for complex learning scenarios and applications involving critical decisions</p><p> </p><p><strong>Incorporating Knowledge Graphs into Deep Learning: Towards better understanding of Images</strong></p><p>Current deep learning systems today have no real understanding of images, with output typically a bunch of bounding boxes, learnt using a large number of label or sentence-level associations. Knowledge graphs like the MIT ConceptNet will be used to understand higher level semantics and relationships between entities, to improve classification accuracy.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","<p> </p><ul>   <li>Minimum Bachelor in Computer Science, Statistics, or Data Science intensive fields, with expertise in one or more of the following areas:    <ul>     <li>Large-scale machine learning</li>     <li>Deep learning, supervised or unsupervised</li>     <li>Applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to practical problems in different domains</li>    </ul> </li>   <li>Experience in corporate or application oriented environments is a plus</li>   <li>Ability to work independently as well as in teams</li>   <li>Good written and communication skills for proposals, reports, and publications</li>   <li>Experience with one of the following: Tensor Flow, Theano, Caffe, CNTK</li>   <li>Strong programming abilities (e. g.

Our strategic thrusts are in the spheres of intelligence, communications and media and our research capabilities are in shared sensor networks, public-public/public-private data-sharing platform, big data analytics and visualization solutions. For more information about I2R, please visit www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg</p><p>We are looking for strong candidates in the field of Artificial intelligence and deep learning, with an interest in working on both fundamental algorithms in large-scale machine learning or deep learning, and also applying it to practical problems in vertical domains.</p><p>The position, based within the Program in Artificial Intelligence at I2R, entails working closely with a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with training from leading universities like MIT, Stanford and CMU.  Listed below are problems of interest in the Deep Learning 2.0 project:</p><p><strong>Multimodal Deep Learning: Towards effective learning from heterogeneous data sources</strong><br> Currently, deep learning is applied in various areas such as visual computing, speech recognition, text mining, etc. In each area, the learning model is trained with large amounts of data in isolation. A multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources, including video, speech, text, etc. is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance.<br> <br> <strong>Unsupervised Deep Learning: Towards 10X fewer labeled samples</strong><br> Labeling large amounts of training data is one of the most time-consuming steps in the deep learning pipeline, and is often not feasible.  The aim is to achieve the same performance with 10x fewer labeled training samples.  This is a strong step in the direction of unsupervised deep learning, where representations are learnt with large amounts of unlabeled unstructured data.</p><p><strong>Deep Learning on Embedded Devices: Towards 100X smaller models</strong><br> Current deep learning models have 10s of millions of neurons, making it infeasible for deployment on mobile and embedded hardware.  The aim is to achieve models that are 100x smaller, with little loss in performance. This capability will also be critical for emerging neuromorphic platforms, where the number of spiking neurons is orders of magnitude smaller than in current state-of-the-art deep learning models.</p><p><strong>Online Deep Learning: Towards Near Real Time (NRT) model updates</strong><br> State-of-the-art deep learning models still take several days to train on expensive GPU infrastructure. A common problem is when new data (including new classes) are constantly added to an evolving, always-learning system.  Algorithms to move towards real-time updates will be essential.</p><p><strong>Extreme Deep Learning: Training 1B neural networks efficiently</strong><br> The high model capacity of deep networks is why increasing amounts of data and model size improves performance.  However, there are substantial challenges in hardware and algorithms challenges in training very large models efficiently. The aim is to address these challenges to achieve more efficient training.</p><p><strong>Deep Learning for Spoken Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding: Towards better modeling of human communication</strong></p><p>Language technology has made great advances through deep learning in the past five years, penetrating fields such as speech recognition and machine translation. However, there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed, ranging from the requirement of specialized linguistic resources to large amounts of annotated data, and to insufficient theoretical grounding in deep learning. This aim attempts to address challenges that are often overlooked by major commercial AI players.</p><p><strong>White-Box Deep Learning: Towards interpretable and contextually informed models</strong><br> Current deep learning models are largely black-boxes that are not informed by contextual relations and provide little intuition. Improved abilities to regulate the learning process, and interpret the resulting predictions will be essential for the next wave of AI applications -- especially for complex learning scenarios and applications involving critical decisions.</p><p><strong>Incorporating Knowledge Graphs into Deep Learning: Towards better understanding of images</strong><br> Current deep learning systems today have no real understanding of images, with output typically a bunch of bounding boxes, learnt using a large number of label or sentence-level associations. Knowledge graphs like the MIT ConceptNet will be used to understand higher-level semantics and relationships between entities, to improve classification accuracy.</p>","<ul> 	<li>PhD in Computer Science, Statistics, Data Science intensive fields with expertise in one or more of the following areas: 	<ul> 		<li>Large-scale machine learning</li> 		<li>Deep learning, supervised or unsupervised</li> 		<li>Applying state-of-art machine learning techniques to practical problems in different domains</li> 	</ul> 	</li> 	<li>Possess PhD experience in corporate or application oriented environments</li> 	<li>Ability to work independently</li> 	<li>Team player</li> 	<li>Experience with Tensor Flow, Theano, Caffe, CNTK skills</li> 	<li>Strong programming skills in Perl, Bash, C/C++, Java, Python, R, MATLAB</li> 	<li>Possess computer vision and deep learning skills</li> 	<li>Good interpersonal and communication skills</li> </ul><p><strong>The above eligibility criteria are not exhaustive.
